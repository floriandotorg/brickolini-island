## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, you need to extract the game assets from your LEGO Island ISO file:

1. Clone the [lego-island-asset-ripper](https://github.com/floriandotorg/lego-island-asset-ripper) repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/floriandotorg/lego-island-asset-ripper.git
   cd lego-island-asset-ripper
   ```

2. Checkout the `hd` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout hd
   ```

3. Extract the assets from your ISO file:
   ```bash
   python extract.py <ISO_FILE>
   ```
   Replace `<ISO_FILE>` with the path to your LEGO Island ISO file. Full extract takes around 5-10 minutes.
   
   Example:
   ```bash
   python extract.py lego_island.iso
   ```

4. Copy the `extract` folder to this project's `public` directory and rename it to `org`:
   ```bash
   cp -r extract /path/to/brickolini/public/org
   ```

    ```
2.  Run the development server:
